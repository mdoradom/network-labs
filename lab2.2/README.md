## Features

### Dual Scene Architecture
- **Client Scene** (Assets/Scenes/ClientScene.unity): Handles client-side networking logic and user interface
- **Server Scene** (Assets/Scenes/ServerScene.unity): Manages server-side connections and data processing

### Network Protocols
- Supports creating TCP or UDP sockets for client-server communication

### Others
- Built with Unity 6000.2.6f2
- Lab documentation in `Docs` directory
